EDITING YOUR Loadout
---
This plugin allows you to have 3 different loadouts, to edit a loadout simply open up the corresponding Loadout#.ini file
and change whichever gun you want added to true, and ones you don't want added to false.

You can also adjust how many rounds you get in the EasyLoadout.ini file along with editing keybinds to quick-give you your loadout aswell as
the keybinds to bring up the money to change which loadout is your active loadout.

As of version 1.6 rifles support advanced attachment customization. If you'd like to change which attachment a rifle has simply change the component string
to another one and it will add it! (If the string isn't a valid component, it'll default to a stored one to prevent crashes!)

As of version 1.10.1 Easy Loadout now supports user-defined amount of loadouts. This means that you can add as many loadouts as you please (Barring any UI limitations).
To do this simply open up EasyLoadout.ini and in the bottom section set LoadoutCount to the total amount of loadouts you want and add a definition for each loadout
under that to corresponding loadout config file. The left side variable has to be formatted the same way so if you were to add a new loadout it would be;
Loadout4 = MyNewLoadout

The config file name can be anything you please, so long as the config exists in /plugins/LSPDFR/EasyLoadout/Configs/
